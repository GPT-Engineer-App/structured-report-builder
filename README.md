# structured-report-builder

Create a `result.html` page using React for our Flask web application where users can generate structured radiological reports (`laudos`). The page should be optimized for performance and user experience, allowing users to select sentences from previously generated radiological reports by clicking and dragging. Users should be able to print the final report seamlessly.
